#  Inference

Often, we have a relatively small sample of data, and want to *infer*
from it something about the properties of a parent or population
distribution. For example: I want to know the height of the average man in Oxford.
* I cannot measure the heights of all men in Oxford (the *population*) as this is impractical
* Instead I go to Carfax and measure the heights of 10 random (adult male) passers by, my *sample*
    *  I calculate the mean - this gives me an *estimate* of the mean height of
all men in Oxford
**However** it is important to as how uncertain this estimate is - in other words, how much might my estimate change if I re-did the experiment and randomly selected 10 different men for my sample?



In the previous section, we explored random variability across samples by looking at the unusual case in which the population or
parent distribution is available to us. We simulated the process of drawing many samples of size n
from a parent distribution, and taking the mean of each sample. The
distribution of these means, known as the **sampling distribution of
the mean**, describes the expected random variability in the mean
for different samples.

For example, the population distribution of IQ is a normal distribution with mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15

$$ IQ_{UK} \sim \mathcal{N}(100, 15^2) $$

Knowing this, we could work out how often the mean IQ in a random sample of, say, $n=10$ people would be as high as 105 by constructing the sampling distribution of the mean, as we did in the previous section.

**In real life, this would never happen!**

Instead we have the converse problem - we have *one* sample, and we have to *estimate* 
* the parameters of the population distribution (usually, its mean)
* Our uncertainty about that estimate

Often, the reason for doing this is to ask whether the data in a sample could plausibly come from some known population. For example, say I sample 10 cat owners and their average IQ is 105. This proves that cat owners are smarter than average, right?

... Maybe not. How likely is it that this higher-than-average IQ could have arisen *if* cat owners were just like everyone else? 

In this section we will think about how to use a sample to create estimates of the population parameters (mean and standard deviation) called **likelihood distributions**.

This will allow us to construct **confidence intervals** for the population mean.

## Tasks for this week

**Conceptual material** is covered in the lecture. In addition to the
live lecture, you can find lecture videos on Canvas.

Please work through the guided exercises in this section (everything
*except* the page labelled "Tutorial Exercises") in advance of
the computer-based tutorial session.

To complete the guided exercises you will need to either:

* open the pages in Google Colab (simply click the Colab button on each page), or
* download them as Jupyter Notbooks to your own computer and work
with them locally (eg in JupyterLab)


If you find something difficult or have questions, you can discuss
with your tutor in the computer-based tutoral session.

This week is particularly heavy on conceptual material, so please do
discuss the guided exercises and tutorial exercises with your tutor to
make sure you understand
