# Learning Objectives


## Conceptual


After this week you should understand the following concepts:

* Definition of probability for discrete and continuous variables
* Statistical independence
* Conditional probability $(pA|B)$
* Joint probability $p(A \cap B)$
* Marginal probability
* Bayes Theorem

You should be able to understand the following probability diagrams
* Probability tree
* Contingency Table
* Bar plot  


This material is covered in both the video (on the introductory page for this chapter) and the text in the chapter

## Python skills

There are no new Python skills, however there are some exercises asking you to find joint and conditional probabilities in an actual dataset, by identifying the relevant rows in a `pandas` dataframe.
