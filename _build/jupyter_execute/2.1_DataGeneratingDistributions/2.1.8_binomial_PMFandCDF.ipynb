    "\n",
    "In this chapter we explored how we would simulate a binomial variable ($k$ hits) to work out how often we expect $k$ hits on $n$ trials. This is called a **numerical solution** or **simulation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an **analytical solution** to calculating the expected number of hits if $k \\sim \\mathcal{B}(n,p)$. This means, there is an equation we can use to work it out. This equation is called the *probability mass function (PMF)*. In this section we introduce the PMF and a related function, the *cumulative density function (CDF)*, for the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you don't need to use the actual equations yourself, as there are built in functions in `scipy.stats` that do it for you. However it is desirable to understand conceptually where the equations 'come from' (how they are derived), as covered in the lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "However you may wish to use the PMF (in Python) to get the probability of a certain value of $k$, rather than simulating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical vs numerical solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we see The PMF and CDF are worked out from an equation rather than by random sampling\n",
    "* Therefore the probability values (eg $p(k<=7)$) given by `stats.binom.pmf()` and `stats.binom.cdf()` never change (for given values of $n,p,k$)\n",
    "* In contrast the values given by our simluations (how many random samples $k<=7$) did vary slightly each time we ran our simulation\n",

    "* *Note* unsurprisingly, many people find the notation $p(k=K)$ (which is standard in statistical theory) confusing. In this case $k$ is a *variable* (the number of hits) and $K$ is a specific value of it - so in a coin-tossing example, where we are interested in the chance of getting 8 heads out of 10 tosses, $k$=number of heads and $K$=8; we read $p(k=8)$ as *\"the probability the number of heads is 8\"*\n",
