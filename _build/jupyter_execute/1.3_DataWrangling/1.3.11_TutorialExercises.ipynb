    "    * highlighting key results with descriptive statistics and figures\n",
    "    * figures should be well labelled and tweaked to make your point as clearly as possible\n",
    "    * there should be clear, readable explanatory text\n",

    "## Crime Survey Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with a dataset extracted from the Crime Survey England and Wales 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "I obtained the data from the UK Data Service, a data repository run by the UK Research Councils. This text is from their introduction to the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a face-to-face victimisation survey in which\n",
    "people resident in households in England and Wales are asked about their experiences of a range of\n",
    "crimes in the 12 months prior to the interview. Respondents to the survey are also asked about their\n",
    "perceptions of crime and attitudes towards crime related issues such as the police and criminal justice\n",
    "system.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset I have given you contains only some of the questions that respondants were asked, containing information about the respondants' individual demographic features, neighbourhood, perceptions of crime and confidence in the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "The brief for the  hand-in report will be to write a short report for the Home Secretary addressing two topics:\n",
    "1. Which groups are the most likely to be victims of crime? and \n",
    "2. What factors affect confidence in policing?, \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the idea is to write for a generic Home Secretary  - they have responsibility for Law and Order and as a politician are interested in how different sections of the public perceive these issues. You can assume they have no statistical training. However there is no need to accommodate the political attitudes or personal characteristics of any particular Home Secretary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these preparatory exercises you will play around with the data to try and work out which factors are important predictors of that confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have put my own conclusions at the bottom of this page - this is just to give an idea of the kinds of things you might look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey was conducted in 2013 in the UK. Events of recent years may have affected the confidence of certain groups in the police; this would not be reflected in the data used here.\n"
