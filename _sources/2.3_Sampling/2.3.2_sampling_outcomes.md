# Learning Objectives

The learning objectives for this week are closely related to those of
the previous week

## Conceptual


After this week you should be able to:

* Define the term *sample* and *population*
* Understand the difference between sampling with and without replacement

* Define the sampling distribution of a statistic (such as the sample mean or proportion)
* Explain how the standard error depends on sample size $n$ and the population variability $\sigma$
* Understand that the estimated sampling distribution of the mean for a population can be
obtained in several ways including:
    * Calculated empirically from the population - draw many samples of size $n$ from the population and plot their means 
    * Modelled using a known distribution (Normal if central limit
theorem applies)




This material is covered in the lecture and recapped in the worked
examples in Python

## Python skills

This week there is an emphasis on simulating the process of drawing a
large number of (re)samples from a sample distribution

The key skill practiced this week is building a `for` loop to
repeat a process many times
(such as drawing a random sample and getting its mean)

You might need to change some variable (such as sample
size n) on each pass through the loop.

Additional new(ish) Python skills:

* sample from a `pandas` dataframe using `pandas.df.sample()`
* Plot an expected distribution such as a curve from the function `stats.norm.pdf()` over a histogram of simulated data
* Plot a Q-Q plot

This material is covered in the Jupyter Notebooks in this section
