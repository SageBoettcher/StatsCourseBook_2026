# Probability

This chapter introduces formal probablity theory. Probabilty theory is the mathematical basis for all statstical tests. This material should be revision for most students (as it is on the GCSE curriculum in the UK). However, we will assume knowledge of these ideas so please do read through this chapter ahead of studying the block on statistical theory.

Here is a lecture video covering the same material. It is about 30 minutes long.
